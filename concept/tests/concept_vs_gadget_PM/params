# Input/output #
################
# IC_file
#     Path to the file containing the initial conditions for the simulation.
#     This is just a regular snapshot, either of the codes own HDF5 type or
#     of the GADGET2 2 type.
# output_dir
#     Path (absolute or relative to the concept directory) to the directory
#     where output snapshots should be stored.
# output_type
#     Determines the type of the produced snapshots. Can be either 'standard'
#     or 'GADGET 2', referring to the codes own HDF5 snapshot type and
#     Gadget2's snapshot type 2, respectively.
# snapshot_base
#     File basename (prefix) for the produced snapshots. The snapshots will be
#     named "snapshot_base"_0, "snapshot_base"_1, "snapshot_base"_2, ...
# outputtimes
#     Tuple of values of the scale factor, for which to dump a snapshot to
#     disk. The minimum value should be larger than a_begin.

########################
# Numerical parameters #
########################
# boxsize
#     The linear size of the simulated cubic box. The simulated volume is
#     then boxsize**3. Remember to provide the unit explicitly!
# ewald_gridsize
#     Linear size of the grid of Ewald corrections. A total of
#     ewald_gridsize**3 Ewald corrections will be tabulated and stored
#     in the file .ewald_gridsize="ewald_gridsize".hdf5
# PM_gridsize
#     Linear size of the mesh used for the PM method. There will then be a
#     total of PM_gridsize**3 mesh points within the simulated box.
# P3M_scale
#     The scale of the gravitational force split into a long-range
#     and a short-range component, given in units of the size of a PM cell.
#     In Gadget the standard value for this is 1.25.
# P3M_cutoff
#     Beyond the distance P3M_cutoff*P3M_scale (in units of PM cells),
#     the short-range force is ignored. Gadget uses a value of 4.5.
#     A value of 4.8 guarantees that the unaccounted part of the force
#     is less than 1% of the total force.
# softeningfactors
#     Dictionary mapping names of species to their respective gravitational
#     softening. The values given correspond to radius of the softening
#     Plummer sphere, in units of the mean interparticle
#     distance (boxsize/N**(1/3)).
# Δt_factor
#     The time step size at any time, given in units of the instantaneous age
#     of the universe.

# Cosmological parameters #
###########################
# H0
#     The Hubble parameter at the present time (a = 1).
#     Remember to provide the unit explicitly! This should match the
#     corresponding value in IC_file!
# Ωm
#     The matter (baryonic + dark) density parameter at the
#     present time (a = 1). This should match the corresponding
#     value in IC_file!
# ΩΛ
#     The dark energy density parameter at the present time (a = 1).
#     This should match the corresponding value in IC_file!
# a_begin
#     The value of the scale factor at the beginning of the simulation.
#     This should match the value scale factor value in IC_file!

# frame_folder
#     Use empty string to not save the frames.
# liveframe
#     The filename should be without extension.

# image_format
#     Supported formats are 'jpeg', 'jpg', 'png', 'tif' and 'tiff'.
# color
#    Tuple of RGB values, each ranging from 0 to 1.
# resolution
#    The height and width of the images, measured in pixels.
#    Note that the images will always be square.
# remote_liveframe
#     This should either be of the form 'user@host:/path/to/liveframe.ext' or
#     'user@host:/path/to/'. In the latter case, the remote file will have
#     the same name as the local file. 
#     The live frame can not be uploaded if liveframe is disabled.
