## **CO*N*CEPT**
![renders](http://users-phys.au.dk/jmd/github/concept/concept_renders.gif)

**CO*N*CEPT** (**CO**smological ***N***-body **C**od**E** in **P**y**T**hon)
is a free and open-source code for cosmological *N*-body simulations on
massively parallel computers with distributed memory. The code is written
almost exclusively in Python, but it achieves C-like performance thanks to
Cython.

For documentation on how to install and use CO*N*CEPT, see<sup>[1](#footnote)</sup> [guide.pdf](guide.pdf).

The physics which CO*N*CEPT strives to emulate, as well as the numerical
methods implemented in order to do so, are presented in<sup>[1](#footnote)</sup> [thesis.pdf](thesis.pdf).
